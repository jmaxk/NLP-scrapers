This contains code for scraping various sites that I have scraped to do NLP research. Some of the sites include:

-Blogger (blogger.com)
-Open Source Parallel corpora (http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/)
-LyricsTranslate (lyricstranslate.com)
-Wiktionary (wiktionary.com)


Keep in mind that these don't all use APIs. A lot of them exploit the html of the site, which can change at any time
